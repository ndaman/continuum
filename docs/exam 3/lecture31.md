# indeterminate beams - superposition

----
## superposition

-   To use superposition for finding deflection of statically indeterminate beams, we must first identify redundant reactions
-   We initially remove these, then superpose them back such that the deflection at that point is 0
-   The choice of which reaction(s) is redundant is arbitrary, we can choose whatever we are most comfortable with
-   We use Appendix C to find deflection and slope

## superposition

![](..\images\indeterminate-deflection.jpg)

We can consider any reaction to be redundant.

----
## higher order indeterminacy

![](..\images\higher-order.jpg)

We need to treat each reaction separately to match Appendix C.

## example 12.22

Determine the moment at B.

# group problems

----
## group one

![](..\images\group-12-4.png)

Determine the reactions at A and B (EI is constant).

----
## group two

![](..\images\group-12-5.png)

Determine the reactions at A and B (EI is constant).

----
## group three

![](..\images\group-12-6.png)

Determine the reactions at A and B. The support at B settles 2 mm. *E* = 200 GPa, *I* = 65.0(10<sup>-6</sup>)m <sup>4</sup>.
