thin-walled pressure vessels
============================

<span>thin-walled pressure vessels</span>

-   If the radius to wall thickness ratio is 10 or more, we can treet a pressure vessule as “thin-walled”

-   Cylindrical pressure vessels will have two primary sources of stress, and serve as an introduction to more general states of combined loading

<span>cylindrical vessels</span>

-   From equilibrium of a section of a cylindrical vessel, we see that
    $$\\begin{aligned}
                \\sum F\_x &= 0\\\\
                &= 2(\\sigma\_1 t dy) - p (2r) dy\\\\
                \\sigma\_1 &= \\frac{pr}{t}
            \\end{aligned}$$

-   Considering another section we can find the longitudinal stress
    $$\\begin{aligned}
                \\sum F\_y &= 0\\\\
                &= \\sigma\_2 (2\\pi rt) - p (\\pi r^2)\\\\
                \\sigma\_2 &= \\frac{pr}{2t}
            \\end{aligned}$$

<span>spherical vessels</span>

-   We can find the stress in spherical vessels using an identical section to the longitudinal section for a cylindrical vessel, and we find that
    $$\\sigma = \\frac{pr}{2t}$$

-   Which is valid everywhere in a cylindrical vessel

<span>example 8.1</span>

-   A cylindrical pressure vessel has an inner diameter of $\\US{4}{ft}$ and a thickness of $\\frac{1}{2}$ in.

-   Determine the maximum internal pressure it can sustain if the maximum stress it can support is $\\US{20}{ksi}$.

-   What is the maximum internal pressure a spherical pressure vessel could sustain under identical conditions?

combined loading
================

<span>combined loading</span>

-   We can use the principle of superposition to treat various loading conditions separately and then add them together to find the total stress

<span>procedure</span>

-   Section the member at the point of interest, internal force components should be drawn acting through the centroid of the section

-   Moment components should be calculated about the centroidal axis

<span>stress components</span>

-   Normal stress: *σ* = *N*/*A*

-   Shear: *τ* = *V**Q*/*I**t*

-   Bending: *σ* = *M**y*/*I*

-   Torsion: *τ* = *T**ρ*/*J*

-   Pressure Vessels: *σ*<sub>1</sub> = *p**r*/*t*, *σ*<sub>2</sub> = *p**r*/2*t*
