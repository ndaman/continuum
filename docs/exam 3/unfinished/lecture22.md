combined loading
================

<span>combined loading</span>

-   We can use the principle of superposition to treat various loading conditions separately and then add them together to find the total stress

<span>procedure</span>

-   Section the member at the point of interest, internal force components should be drawn acting through the centroid of the section

-   Moment components should be calculated about the centroidal axis

<span>stress components</span>

-   Normal stress: *σ* = *N*/*A*

-   Shear: *τ* = *V**Q*/*I**t*

-   Bending: *σ* = *M**y*/*I*

-   Torsion: *τ* = *T**ρ*/*J*

-   Pressure Vessels: *σ*<sub>1</sub> = *p**r*/*t*, *σ*<sub>2</sub> = *p**r*/2*t*

plane stress transformation
===========================

<span>plane stress</span>

-   In general, the state of stress at a point is characterized by six stress components

-   In practice, this is rare, as most stresses and forces act in the same plane

-   This case is referred to as plane stress

<img src="../figures/transformation" alt="image" style="width:80.0%" />

<span>procedure</span>

-   If the state of stress (*σ*<sub>*x*</sub>, *σ*<sub>*y*</sub>, *τ*<sub>*x**y*</sub>) is known for a known axis system *x* and *y*, we can find the stress relative to some rotated coordinate system

-   We do this by considering a section of the element perpendicular to the *x*<sup>′</sup> axis

-   Sum of forces in *x* and *y* will give *σ*<sub>*x*<sup>′</sup></sub> and *τ*<sub>*x*<sup>′</sup>*y*<sup>′</sup></sub>

-   A second section is needed to find *σ*<sub>*y*<sup>′</sup></sub>, perpendicular to the *y*<sup>′</sup> axis
