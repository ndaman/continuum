superposition
=============

<span>superposition</span>

-   The differential equation *E**I**d*<sup>4</sup>*v*/*d**x*<sup>4</sup> = *w*(*x*) satisfies the requirements for superposition

-   *w*(*x*) is linearly related to *v*(*x*)

-   Load does not significantly change the shape of the beam

<span>superposition</span>

-   This means we can superpose multiple deflection solutions from simpler cases

-   Appendix C in the text has many solutions that can be superposed

statically indeterminate beams
==============================

<span>statically indeterminate</span>

-   If we have redundant supports, we can have some difficulty finding the displacement

-   There are several approaches to solve these problems, we will consider direct integration and superposition

<span>integration</span>

-   We can take the extra unknowns and include them in our formulation for *M*(*x*)

-   They will be solved for with the extra boundary conditions applied
