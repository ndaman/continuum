statically indeterminate beams
==============================

<span>statically indeterminate</span>

-   If we have redundant supports, we can have some difficulty finding the displacement

-   There are several approaches to solve these problems, we will consider direct integration and superposition

<span>integration</span>

-   We can take the extra unknowns and include them in our formulation for *M*(*x*)

-   They will be solved for with the extra boundary conditions applied

indeterminate beams - superposition
===================================

<span>superposition</span>

-   To use superposition for finding deflection of statically indeterminate beams, we must first identify redundant reactions

-   We initially remove these, then superpose them back such that the deflection at that point is 0

-   The choice of which reaction(s) is redundant is arbitrary, we can choose whatever we are most comfortable with

-   We use Appendix C to find deflection and slope
