shear flow in built-up members
==============================

<span>built-up members</span>

-   Often in practice, structural members are “built-up”

-   This refers to parts that are comprised of several other parts to have greater strength in certain areas

-   We need to analyze the shear between these members to choose appropriate adhesives or fasteners

-   From equilibrium we see that
    $$dF = \\frac{dM}{I} \\int\_{A^\\prime} y dA^\\prime$$

-   We recall that this integral represents *Q*, we can also define the shear flow as *q* = *d**F*/*d**x* and recall that *d**M*/*d**x* = *V* to find
    $$q = \\frac{VQ}{I}$$

<span>fastener spacing</span>

-   We can use shear flow to determine fastener spacing

-   Say a fastener can support a shear force of *F*<sub>0</sub> before failure

-   The shear flow (force/distance) times the spacing (distance) will give the shear force per fastener
    *F* = *q**s*

<span>multiple fasteners</span>

-   When multiple arms are connecting the same area (as shown in the previous slide)

-   The shear flow “seen” by each fastener is *q*/*n* where *n* is the number of fastners per area
