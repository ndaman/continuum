$650\si{mm}^2$.](../figures/example-1-8){width="50.00000%"}

average shear stress
====================

[shear stress]{}

-   If we consider a section from a bridge-like structure we can
    demonstrate one way shear stress can be formed in a material

-   As a reminder, shear stress is formed by forces acting in the plane
    of a section cut

[shear stress equilibrium]{}

-   If we consider equilibrium of an element subjected to shear on one
    face, we will find that there must be shear forces on other faces to
    remain in equilibrium

-   In the following example, we will consider the sum of forces in the
    y-direction and the sum of moments about the x-axis

-   Note: we can convert between stresses and forces by recalling that
    $\sigma = F/A$, or $F = \sigma A$

allowable stress design
=======================

[allowable stress]{}

-   Most of the time, we design structures so the stress is less than
    some limit

-   By setting a conservative allowable stress, we account for some
    manufacturing tolerances, unintended loads, and variability in
    mechanical properties

[factor of safety]{}

-   The factor of safety is the failure load divided by the allowable
    load $$FS = \frac{F_{fail}}{F_{allow}}$$

-   Since load and stress are linearly proportional, we could also
    define the factor of safety in terms of stress and it would be
    identical

[factor of safety]{}

-   Typical values for the factor of safety will vary based on
    application

-   Aircraft and space vehicles might have a factor close to 1 to
    minimize weight

-   Nuclear power plants might have a factor close to 3 since weight is
    not as important and failure would be catastrophic

[simple connections]{}

-   We can rearrange the equations $\sigma=N/A$ and $\tau=V/A$ to size
    components based on some allowable stress $$\begin{aligned}
                A &= \frac{N}{\sigma_{allow}}\\
                A &= \frac{V}{\tau_{allow}}
            \end{aligned}$$

limit state design
==================

[limit state design]{}

-   Allowable stress design accounts for uncertainty in the applied
    loading and the material properties in one factor of safety

-   Limit state design separates these two into load and resistance
    factors

[load factors]{}

-   The load factor combines uncertainty in various types of load

-   For example, a building can have loading from a few different
    sources, such as its own weight, people in the building, and snow on
    top of the building

-   Weight is considered a “dead load” and can usually be determined
    more precisely than moving things like people

[load factors]{}

-   In this simple example, we consider a load factor, $\gamma_D=1.2$
    for the dead load, $\gamma_L=1.6$ and $\gamma_S=0.5$
    $$R = 1.2D + 1.6L + 0.5S$$

-   These load factors combine the concept of a safety factor with the
    probability that loads will occur

[resistance factors]{}

-   Resistance factors, $\phi$ are used to express the probability a
    material will fail at its limit load

-   If we are very confident in the failure stress of a material (i.e.
    steel has little variability), we might use $\phi=0.9$

-   If we are not as confident, (using a new material, or an organic
    material like wood with higher variability), we might use $\phi=0.7$

[design criteria]{}

-   If we call the nominal load $P$, then we can combine load and
    resistance factors using $$\phi P \ge R$$

[example 1-12]{}

![Determine to the nearest 1/4" the diameters of steel pins at $A$ and
$C$ if the factor of safety in shear is 1.5 and the failure shear stress
is 12 ksi.](../figures/example-1-12){width="50.00000%"}

[example 1-15]{}

![The 400 kg uniform bar, $AB$ is supported by a steel rod $AC$ and a
roller at $B$. If it supports a live distributed loading, determine the
required diameter of the rod. Use $\sigma_{fail}=345 \si{MPa}$ with
$\phi=0.9$, $\gamma_D=1.2$, and
$\gamma_L=1.6$](../figures/example-1-15){width="40.00000%"}
