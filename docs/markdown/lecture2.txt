stress
======

[Stress]{}

-   For a continuous and cohesive material, consider an infinitely small
    cube of material

-   A finite force, $\Delta F$ will act on this material, and we can
    consider its three components, $\Delta F_x$, $\Delta F_y$, and
    $\Delta F_z$

-   The limit of the force divided by the area of the cube is defined as
    stress

[normal stress]{}

-   The stress acting normal to a face of the cube is referred to as the
    normal stress $$\begin{aligned}
                \sigma_x &= \lim_{\Delta A_x \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_x}{\Delta A_x}\\
                \sigma_y &= \lim_{\Delta A_y \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_y}{\Delta A_y}\\
                \sigma_z &= \lim_{\Delta A_z \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_z}{\Delta A_z}
            \end{aligned}$$

[shear stress]{}

-   Similarly, forces acting tangent to the face of the cube create
    shear stresses

-   Often (but not always), $\tau$ is used instead of $\sigma$ for shear
    stresses $$\begin{aligned}
                \tau_{xy} &= \lim_{\Delta A_y \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_x}{\Delta A_y}\\
                \tau_{yz} &= \lim_{\Delta A_z \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_y}{\Delta A_z}\\
                \tau_{xz} &= \lim_{\Delta A_x \to 0} \frac{\Delta F_z}{\Delta A_x}
            \end{aligned}$$

[general stress]{}

body](../figures/generalstress){width="70.00000%"}

[units]{}

-   stress has units of force per area

-   In metric units, this is Pa (or often MPa and GPa)

-   In english units, this is psi (or often ksi)

average normal stress
=====================

[average normal stress]{}

-   We can use statics to find the statically equivalent normal force
    acting on some cross-section

-   The average normal stress will be the normal force divided by the
    area of the cross-section

-   If a bar is loaded at different points, or if it changes
    cross-sectional area, the average normal stress can vary, we can
    find the stress at different cross-sections to find the maximum
    average normal stress

[example 1.5]{}

[example 1.8]{}

![Determine the position, $x$, of the vertical load so that the average
compressive stress at $C$ is equal to the average tensile stress in the
rod $AB$. The rod has a cross-sectional area of $400\si{mm}^2$ and the
contact at $C$ has an area of
$650\si{mm}^2$.](../figures/example-1-8){width="50.00000%"}

average shear stress
====================

[shear stress]{}

-   If we consider a section from a bridge-like structure we can
    demonstrate one way shear stress can be formed in a material

-   As a reminder, shear stress is formed by forces acting in the plane
    of a section cut

[shear stress equilibrium]{}

-   If we consider equilibrium of an element subjected to shear on one
    face, we will find that there must be shear forces on other faces to
    remain in equilibrium

-   In the following example, we will consider the sum of forces in the
    y-direction and the sum of moments about the x-axis

-   Note: we can convert between stresses and forces by recalling that
    $\sigma = F/A$, or $F = \sigma A$
