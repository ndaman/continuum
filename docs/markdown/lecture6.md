# stress-strain

----
## stress-strain

-   Most engineering materials can be characterized by their stress-strain diagram
-   Comes from a tensile or compressive test, where a load is applied (gives stress) and the strain is measured (via an extensometer or strain gauge)
-   *Engineering stress* is plotted on the y-axis vs. *engineering strain* on the x-axis

----
## stress-strain

![A stress-strain diagram for a typical metal. From left to right, the stress increases linearly until reaching the proportional limit, or yield stress, at which point the stress does not increase very much with increasing strain. When the strain reaches the strain hardening region, the stress begins to increase again with increasing strain until the material fails.](images\stress-strain.jpg)<!-- .element width="70%"-->

----
## elastic behavior

-   Most of the time, the linear region is the one we are most interested in
-   In this region, the material is elastic, meaning when the load is removed the material will return to its original state

----
## elastic behavior

-   Because the stress-strain curve is a straight line, we can relate stress and strain with a single constant
-   This constant is known as the *modulus of elasticity* or *Young's modulus*
`$$ \sigma=E \epsilon $$`

----
## plastic behavior

-   Yielding occurs when stress increases beyond the *yield stress* or *elastic limit*, this is when plastic deformation occurs, meaning the material will not go back to its original shape
-   Strain hardening is common in many metals, and means as more stress is applied the material becomes more stiff

----
## plastic behavior

-   Necking occurs when the material begins to have a noticeable "neck" due to being stretched very thin and lower forces are required to deform the material

----
## true stress-strain

-   True stress and strain use the actual material cross-section (instead of the original cross-section) to calculate stress and strain
-   In the elastic region the difference is negligible, so in many cases we just stick with engineering strain, even if we know it is *wrong*

----
## ductile materials

-   Ductile materials can undergo large strains before failure
-   One way to report how ductile a material is is known as percent elongation
-   Steel, brass, molybdenum, and zinc exhibit similar ductile stress-strain characteristics
-   Aluminum is often considered ductile, but itâ€™s stress-strain behavior is a bit different

----
## brittle materials

-   Materials that exhibit little or no yielding before failure are called *brittle*
-   Cast iron, concrete, and glass are common brittle materials
-   Brittle materials fail easily in tension, but are very strong in compression

----
## strain hardening

![A stress-strain diagram showing how strain hardening works. A material is loaded beyond its elastic limit, and then unloaded. If it is loaded again, it will not yield until it reaches the final stress to which it had been previously loaded (but it will not have as much toughness).](images\strain-hardening.jpg) <!-- .element width="40%"-->

---
# strain energy

----
## strain energy

-   Work in physics is defined as force times distance
-   As a force is applied to a material, the energy from the work done by the load is stored in the material and called strain energy
-   In engineering, we often use the strain energy density, or the amount of strain energy per unit volume of material
$$u = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma \\epsilon$$

----
## toughness

-   Graphically, the area under the stress strain curve represents the strain energy density
-   We call the entire region (usually for a ductile material) the *toughness*
-   Some hardened steels have a high failure strength, but are not very ductile, this gives them a lower toughness

## example 3.3

<div class="left">
![A bar is under a 10 kilonewton tensile load. One section of the bar is 600 mm long with a 20 mm diameter, while the other section is 400 mm long with a 15 mm diameter. The stress-strain diagram below shows that for a stress of 56.59 MPa there will be a strain of .045](images\example-3-3.png)
</div>

<div class="right">
The aluminum rod shown has a circular cross-section. Determine the elongation of the rod when load is applied using the given stress-strain diagram.
</div>

---
# poisson's ratio

----
## poisson's ratio

-   When a material is stretched in one direction, it tends to contract in the transverse direction
-   The ratio of transverse to axial strain is called *Poisson's ratio*
$$\\nu = - \\frac{\\epsilon\_{transverse}}{\\epsilon\_{axial}}$$

---
# shear stress-strain

----
## shear stress-strain

-   It can be experimentally difficult to obtain a state of pure shear, but a common method for many materials is to place a thin tube in torsion
-   For most engineering materials, the shear stress-strain behavior is linear in the elastic region, but has a different constant relating stress to strain, known as the *Shear Modulus*
$$\tau=G \gamma $$

----
## elastic constants

-   For most materials, *E*, *G* and `$\nu$` are related by the following expression
$$G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$

----
## example 3.5

<div class="left">
![A block 4 inches deep, 3 inches wide, and 2 inches tall is loaded in shear (in the 3 inch direction). The stress-strain diagram shows that at the elastic limit of 52 ksi there is a strain of 0.008.](images\example-3-5.png)
</div>
<div class="right">
Determine G for the specimen shown. Also find the maximum distance d, that the top could be displaced horizontally while remaining elastic. What force V is required to cause this displacement?
